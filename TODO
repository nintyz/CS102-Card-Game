MatchCardController.java - reorganise code for repeated functions (DONE)
                         - reset all selected cards after player switch (DONE)
                         - passing of data of cards in imagView to identify selected cards
                         - when selecting or deselecting cards add/remove from array
                         - remove selected cards from view after match button clicked
                         - implement logic when pressing match button (DONE)
                                -> no selected cards, disable button (DONE)
                                -> only hand/cardpool selected, disable button (DONE)
                                -> if there's card selected in hand and in pool, run capture, calculate score into Player
                                        *** capture should remove any valid combinations from hand/pool
                         - add game logic

Player.java - add resetScore (DONE)

GENERAL
-------------------
- need to restructure how capture and all the combo types work together
    -> fix abstract classes (errors cuz abstract methods not overriding) (DONE - Xavier)
    -> current code too messy and hard to understand (eliminated redundant overriding - Xavier)

- ending screen
    -> end screen show when player reaches specified number of points
    -> option to play again or quit
    -> need move all initialize calls at top to its own function to properly reset game

- implement logic for discarding cards
    - add discard button below match button
    - if ONLY 1 card is selected from PLAYER HAND, remove card and append to the card pool
    - dont allow if cardpool has 10 cards. (our cardpool limit for now)
    - logic to prevent action from discard button if above condition doesnt meet (display alert for this as well)
    - display alert if they want discard, if not, continue code and dont do anything
